hub_logic.py - DLL Developer Hub "logic" functions (Version 2)

These functions do the actual work of the app (load data, search, validate,
save, review) but never call print() or input(). That way both the command
line version (main.py) and the Streamlit version (app.py) can reuse them.

Written with AI assistance (GitHub Copilot) while refactoring Version 1.
