main.py - DLL Developer Hub Prototype (command-line version)

This is the command-line version of the app. It implements the home menu plus
the main activities from the project spec:
  1) API Catalog         - browse/search finance API products and view their specs
  2) Request Credentials - submit (simulated) credential requests and check status
  3) Admin Review        - approve requests or ask for more information

In Version 2 all of the "logic" (loading data, searching, validating, saving,
reviewing) moved to hub_logic.py so the Streamlit app (app.py) can reuse it.
This file now only handles printing and keyboard input.

Functions marked "AI-generated" below were added with AI help because I was having a
difficult time writing them myself.
